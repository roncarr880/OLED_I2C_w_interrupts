# OLED_I2C_w_interrupts
Experiments with a TWI ( I2C ) interrupt handler\
\
The two altered header files are part of the OLED_I2C library by Rinky Dink Electronics and the ino file is an altered example that uses interrupts to avoid waiting on I2C transfers to complete.\
\
In the zip is another version, based upon the Nokia library LCD_Basic.  The SPI has been converted to I2C.  This version does not use a frame buffer and is useful for small memory processors like the UNO,Nano.
